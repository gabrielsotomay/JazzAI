- The user is presented with an analysis of their playing
-   Artists they resemble
-   Parts that sound good/bad
-   Ideas on how to improve their soloing/what is missing from their playing

## Milestones
- use [basic pitch](https://huggingface.co/spotify/basic-pitch) or demucs to separate out the saxophone from a jazz song
- 

## Current tasks
- Compile the literature on
  - existing music transcription software/projects
  - existing jazz analysis AI projects
  - helpful tools
- Devise a basic architecture/pipeline for the project
